    Building Design Guide<br>

  <hr>
  <p align="left">This document describes how to create your own buildings for 
    the Skyscraper simulator, and also describes all of the available commands. 
    Please note that the commands and syntax will change frequently during the 
    simulator's development, and formatting will be cleaned up to make the code 
    more readable. A graphical building designer is planned, which will generate 
    these script files based on simplified CAD-like floorplan layouts, and will 
    also allow the user to view the building in 3D as it's being created.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><strong><font size="+1">1. Starting a new building</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">Buildings are stored in text files in Skyscraper's <em>buildings</em> 
    folder, usually at c:\program files\skyscraper\buildings on Windows, or in 
    the &quot;buildings&quot; directory on Unix. The filenames end in BLD, and 
    so you need to make sure your text file ends with &quot;.bld&quot; and not 
    &quot;.txt&quot;. To create a new building, first open up a text editor, and 
    read the instructions below. When you're finished, save it into the <em>buildings</em> 
    folder shown above, as something like &quot;mybuilding.bld&quot;. The building 
    will appear in Skyscraper's buildings list the next time you run it. A simplistic 
    building is included for you to get a good idea of the overall format of a 
    typical building data file. You might also want to open one of the other buildings 
    that come with Skyscraper (&quot;Triton Center.bld&quot;, &quot;Glass Tower.bld&quot;, 
    etc) for examples on the more advanced functions. Please note that the script 
    syntax will change in the future.</p>

  <p align="left"><strong><font size="+1">2. General Stuff</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>1. Comments</strong></p>
  <p align="left">To add a comment to your file, simply put the # symbol right 
    before your comment. For example:<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"># This is a comment</font></p>
  <p align="left">It's a good idea to use comment markers to add a title header 
    at the top of your building file. The Triton Center file has this header:<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">#The Triton Center<br>
    #Copyright &copy;2003-2010 Ryan Thoryk</font></p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    <strong>2. Variables</strong></p>
  <p align="left">Variables are marked with percent signs (%), and most system 
    variables will be described later. There are 256 user variables (0-255) which 
    can be set using the Set command:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><br>
    Set 2 = 100<br>
    </font>and then can be used later:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><br>
    Height = %2%<br>
    </font></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>3. IF statements</strong></p>
  <p align="left">Basic IF statements can be made, with the following syntax:<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">if[<em>expression</em>] command</font></p>
  <p align="left">Available signs are = (equals), &gt; (greater than), &lt; (less 
    than), ! (is not), &amp; (and) and | (or). Expressions can also be enclosed 
    in parenthesis. Note that the IF statement only works with the current line, 
    and does not currently support multiple lines within an IF block, an &quot;else&quot; 
    statement, or nesting.</p>
  <p align="left">For example, to set the height to 9.5 if the floor number is 
    less than 82:<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">if[%floor% &lt; 82] Height 
    = 9.5</font></p>
  <p align="left">This example shows a complex expression:<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">if[%floor% &lt; 82 &amp; 
    (%height% = 3 | %height% = 5)] Height = 9.5</font></p>
  <p align="left">In the above example, the statement will be true if the <em>floor</em> 
    value is less than 82 and if the <em>height</em> value is either 3 or 5.<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>4. Inline calculations</strong></p>
  <p align="left">Values can be calculated inline by using the following math 
    operators: <br>
    + (plus), - (minus), / (divide), and * (multiply).</p>
  <p align="left">They can be used anywhere in the data file. Here's an example 
    of one being used with the Set command:<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Set 1 = %floorheight% + 10</font></p>
  <p align="left">Parenthesis are also supported, for grouped operations. Here's 
    an example of a complex math expression:<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Set 5 = %height% + (%interfloorheight% 
    * (4 / %altitude%))</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><br>
    </font><strong>5. Object parameters from outside floor sections</strong></p>
  <p align="left">Information about a certain floor can be obtained elsewhere 
    in the script, by referencing the floor in this manner:</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Floor(<em>number</em>).<em>parameter</em></font></p>
  <p align="left">Available parameters are Altitude, Height, FullHeight and InterfloorHeight. 
    Note that this function must only be called after the specified floor has 
    been created.</p>
  <p align="left">Example:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><br>
    Set 1 = Floor(5).Altitude</font></p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    <strong>6. Global commands or functions that can be used anywhere in the script</strong></p>
  <p align="left">In this section, <em>Destobject</em> refers to the destination 
    object to create other objects in. It can be either <em>floor </em>(only available 
    within a Floor section)<em>, external</em>, <em>landscape</em>, or <em>buildings</em> 
    (more will come soon). When the command is used inside a <em>Floor</em> section, 
    and <em>Destobject</em> is not <em>floor</em>, the altitude of the current 
    floor will be used, and altitude/y values specified in these commands will 
    be offsets of that altitude.</p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    <strong>a. AddTriangleWall</strong> - adds a textured triangular wall<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddTriangleWall <em>destobject, 
    name, texturename</em>, <em>x1</em>, <em>y1</em>, <em>z1</em>, <em>x2</em>, 
    <em>y2</em>, <em>z2</em>, <em>x3</em>, <em>y3</em>, <em>z3</em>, <em>tw</em>, 
    <em>th</em></font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddTrianglewall 
    external, My Triangle, brick, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0</font></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>b. AddWall</strong> - adds a textured wall<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddWall <em>destobject, 
    name, texturename</em>, <em>thickness, x1</em>, <em>z1</em>, <em>x2</em>, 
    z2, <em>height1</em>, <em>height2</em>, <em>altitude1</em>, <em>altitude2</em>, 
    <em>tw</em>, <em>th</em></font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddWall buildings, 
    Wall1, brick, 0.5, -10, -10, 10, 10, 15, 15, Floor(2).Altitude, Floor(2).Altitude, 
    0, 0</font></p>
  <p align="left">The command's parameters are the same as the Floor section's 
    AddWall command.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>c. AddFloor</strong> - adds a textured floor<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddFloor <em>destobject, 
    name, texturename</em>, <em>thickness, x1</em>, <em>z1</em>, <em>x2</em>, 
    <em>z2</em>, <em>altitude1</em>, <em>altitude2</em>, <em> tw</em>, <em>th</em></font></p>
  <p align="left">The command's parameters are the same as the Floor section's 
    AddFloor command.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>d. AddGround</strong> - adds a tile-based ground<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddGround <em> name, 
    texturename</em>, <em>x1</em>, <em>z1</em>, <em>x2</em>, <em>z2</em>, <em>altitude</em>, 
    <em>tile_x</em>, <em>tile_y<br>
    </em></font>Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddGround 
    AddGround Ground, Downtown, -158400, -158400, 158400, 158400, 0, 7920, 7920</font></p>
  <p align="left">This command is mainly for creating large ground sections, since 
    using the AddFloor function with a large amount of texture tiling causes interference 
    problems. The X and Z values specify the total size of the ground, and the 
    tile_x and tile_y specify the size of each tile square to create. For example, 
    if the ground is 10,000 feet wide, and tile_x and tile_y are both 1000, then 
    100 total tiles will be created; 10 wide and 10 deep. In the example above 
    7920 is 1/40 of the total width (316800 which is 158400 * 2), so the tile 
    grid will be 40x40 tiles.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>e. CreateWallBox</strong> - creates 4 walls (box) at 
    the specified coordinate locations<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CreateWallBox <em>destobject</em>, 
    <em>name, texturename</em>, <em>x1</em>, <em>x2</em>, <em>z1</em>, <em>z2</em>, 
    <em>height</em>, <em>voffset</em>, <em>tw</em>, <em>th, inside, outside, top, 
    bottom </em></font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CreateWallBox external, 
    My Box, brick, -10, 10, -10, 10, 15, 0, 0, 0, true, true, true, true</font></p>
  <p align="left">The parameters in this command are very similar to the ones 
    in the AddWall command shown below in the Floor section, except that a box 
    is created instead of a single wall. <em>Inside</em> and <em>outside</em> 
    determine if the wall should be visible from the inside/outside, and <em>top</em> 
    and <em>bottom</em> determine if the top and bottom walls should be drawn.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>f. CreateWallBox2</strong> - creates 4 walls (box) at 
    a specified central location<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CreateWallBox2 <em>destobject</em>, 
    <em>name, texturename</em>, <em>centerx</em>, <em>centerz</em>, <em>widthx</em>, 
    <em>lengthz</em>, <em>height</em>, <em>voffset</em>, <em>tw</em>, <em>th</em></font><font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><em>, 
    inside, outside, top, bottom </em></font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CreateWallBox2 external, 
    My Box, brick, 0, 0, 10, 10, 15, 0, 0, 0, false, true, false, false</font></p>
  <p align="left">The parameters are the same as the above command, except that<em> 
    centerx</em> and <em>centerz</em> define the center of the box, and <em>widthx</em> 
    and <em>lengthz</em> specify the width and length off of the center.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>g. AddCustomWall</strong> - creates a custom polygon (wall, floor, 
    etc) with any number of vertex points. For example, a triangular wall has 
    3 vertex points, and a standard wall has 4. This function allows at least 
    3 vertices.<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddCustomWall <em>destobject, 
    name, texturename, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, x3, y3, z3, ..., tw, th</em></font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddCustomWall external, 
    My Wall, brick, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, 10, 10, 0, 10, 0, 10, 0, 0</font></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>h. AddShaft</strong> - creates a shaft at a specified 
    location and floor range<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddShaft number, 
    type, centerx, centerz, startfloor, endfloor</font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddShaft 1, 2, 10, 
    10, 0, 9</font></p>
  <p align="left">The number parameter specifies the shaft number to create. <em>Type</em> 
    is either 1 for a pipe/utility shaft, 2 for an elevator shaft, and 3 for a 
    stairwell shaft. This command just tells the simulator the area that the shaft 
    will take up, and does not create the actual shaft walls. Later on when you 
    create the walls/floors for the shaft, make sure that you make a floor at 
    the very bottom and very top of the shaft (they can extend beyond the walls).</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>i. CreateStairwell</strong> - creates a stairwell at 
    a specified location and floor range<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CreateStairwell number, 
    centerx, centerz, startfloor, endfloor</font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CreateStairwell 
    1, 10, 10, 0, 9</font></p>
  <p align="left">The number parameter specifies the stairwell number to create. 
    This command just tells the simulator the area that the stairwell will take 
    up, and does not create the actual walls.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>j. WallOrientation</strong> - changes the internal wall 
    orientation parameter, which is used for determining the wall thickness boundaries 
    in relation to their coordinates.<br>
    Syntax:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> WallOrientation = 
    <em>direction</em></font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">WallOrientation 
    = left</font></p>
  <p align="left">The direction parameter can either be left, center, or right. 
    Center is default. For example, if center is used, than half of the wall's 
    thickness is to the right (positive) of it's x1/x2 or z1/z2 coordinates, and 
    half is to the left (negative) of the coordinates. If left is used, than the 
    coordinates define the wall's left (negative) edge, and the full thickness 
    is to the right (positive) of those. If right is used, then again the coordinates 
    define the wall's right (positive) edge, and the full thickness is to the 
    left (negative) of those. See this graphic for a good example:</p>
  <p align="left"><img src="guide/wall_info.jpg"></p>
  <p align="left">In the graphic above, the large box at the top shows what the 
    X and Z coordinates correspond to. The lower examples show the wall orientation 
    as left or right, and if either the difference in x values or z values is 
    larger.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>k. FloorOrientation</strong> - changes the internal 
    floor orientation parameter, which is used for determining the floor thickness 
    boundaries in relation to their coordinates.<br>
    Syntax:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> FloorOrientation 
    = <em>direction</em></font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">FloorOrientation 
    = bottom</font></p>
  <p align="left">The direction parameter can either be bottom, center, or top. 
    Top is default. For example, if center is used, than half of the floor's thickness 
    is above (positive) it's x1/x2 or z1/z2 coordinates, and half is below (negative) 
    the coordinates. If bottom is used, than the coordinates define the floor's 
    bottom edge, and the full thickness is the top (positive). If top is used, 
    then again the coordinates define the floor's top edge, and the full thickness 
    is the bottom (negative).</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>l. DrawWalls</strong> - specifies which parts of a wall 
    or floor should be drawn.<br>
    Syntax:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> DrawWalls = <em>MainNegative, 
    MainPositive, SideNegative, SidePositive, Top, Bottom</em></font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">DrawWalls = true, 
    true, false, false, false, false</font></p>
  <p align="left">The example shown is the default setting. This can seem complex, 
    but I'll provide a graphic soon to explain it more easily. MainNegative is 
    the main (that makes up the length if a wall, or the main area if a floor) 
    face on the negative side, MainPositive is the main face on the positive side, 
    SideNegative is the side (the part that is along the thickness) face on the 
    negative side, SidePositive is the side face on the positive side; Top refers 
    to either the top side if a wall, or to the positive X face if a floor; Bottom 
    refers to either the bottom side if a wall, or the negative X face if a floor. 
    In the graphic above in the WallOrientation section, let's say that the large 
    box's difference in x values are larger (meaning that it is horizontal from 
    the left to the right), and that it has the same z values. With that, MainNegative 
    would be the front wall, MainPositive the back, SideNegative the left, SidePositive 
    the right, etc.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>m. SetPlanarMapping</strong> - sets the planar texture mapper's parameters.<br>
    Syntax:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> SetPlanarMapping Flat, X, Y, Z</font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">SetPlanarMapping false, false, false, true</font></p>
  <p align="left">X, Y and Z reverse the texture mapping per axis, and Flat has it ignore depth.  Skyscraper by default uses a simple planar texture mapper, which 
    in simple terms draws the texture in a box around the object. With a basic 
    wall, the top-left of the texture image is mapped to the top left of the wall, 
    the top-right is mapped to the top-right of the wall, etc. If you want the 
    top-right of the texture mapped to the top-left of the wall for example (to 
    flip or change alignment), you'd set X to false. This command is mainly used 
    to change alignment - since the top-left of the texture is mapped to the top-left 
    of the object, that means that textures have a left/top alignment by default. 
    If you change X to true, it'll be right-aligned. If you change Y to true, 
    it'll be bottom-aligned. See this picture for an example:</p>
  <p align="left"><img src="guide/extents.jpg"></p>
  <p align="left">In the above picture, I tiled a texture (a black box with yellow 
    around it) 2.5 times on width and height. The bottom floor shows the default 
    texture mapping (ReverseExtents false, false, false); you'll notice that it's 
    aligned to the top-left. In the middle one, I set the X value to true (ReverseExtents 
    true, false, false). In the top one, I set the Y value to true (ReverseExtents 
    false, true, false).</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>m. SetTextureMapping</strong> - manually sets UV texture 
    mapping for all polygons generated after this command; ResetTextureMapping 
    restores the values to the defaults or previous<br>
    Syntax:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> SetTextureMapping 
    vertex1, u1, v1, vertex2, u2, v2, vertex3, u3, v3</font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">SetTextureMapping 
    0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1</font></p>
  <p align="left">The example shown above is the default value used by the simulator. 
    This command maps the texture coordinates to the specified 3 vertex indices 
    - normally a side of a wall will have 4 vertices/sets of coordinates (0 to 
    3), and by default the first three are used (top left, top right and bottom 
    right respectively), with the UV coordinates representing the size percentage 
    of the texture (with 1 being 100%, 0.5 being 50%, etc; normally this would 
    relate to absolute texture coordinates) - so in the example, texture coordinate 
    0,0 (top left) is mapped at the first vertex (top left); texture coordinate 
    1,0 (really &quot;width, 0&quot;) being mapped at the second vertex (top right), 
    and texture coordinate 1,1 (really &quot;width, height&quot;) being mapped 
    to the bottom right. For a standard wall, the valid vertex values are from 
    0 to 3. If a wall or floor is created with AddCustomWall, and if it has for 
    example 7 vertex points, the valid values for this command would then be 0 
    to 6 (but only 3 vertices can be used for mapping purposes). Textures can 
    also be cropped with this command - for example, to map only a central square 
    of a texture, you'd use:<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">SetTextureMapping 0, 0.25, 
    0.25, 1, 0.75, 0.25, 2, 0.75, 0.75</font></p>
  <p align="left">Here's an easier way to see the example above:</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">0 -&gt; 0, 
    0<br>
    1 -&gt; 1, 0<br>
    2 -&gt; 1, 1</font></p>
  <p align="left">The following diagram shows the mapping described above. Texture 
    location 0,0 is mapped to wall vertex 0, location 1,0 is mapped to vertex 
    1, etc:</p>
  <p align="left"><img src="guide/texture_mapping.jpg" width="300" height="300"></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>n. SetTextureMapping2</strong> - advanced version of 
    SetTextureMapping - manually sets UV texture mapping for all polygons generated 
    after this command; ResetTextureMapping restores the values to the defaults 
    or previous<br>
    Syntax:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> SetTextureMapping2 
    v1x, v1y, v1z, u1, v1, v2x, v2y, v2z, u2, v2, v3x, v3y, v3z, u3, v3</font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">SetTextureMapping2 
    x0, y0, z0, 0, 0, x1, y1, z1, 1, 0, x2, y2, z2, 1, 1</font></p>
  <p align="left">See the above description of SetTextureMapping for a detailed 
    description on texture mapping in general. This command mostly does the same 
    as that command, and the example given is the default command (and is equivalent 
    to the SetTextureMapping example). Instead of just choosing which vertex indices 
    to use like SetTextureMapping, this command lets you create your own texture 
    vertices (sets of coordinates) using coordinates of already-existing vertices. 
    The vertex values that can be used start with an &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; 
    or &quot;z&quot;, followed by the vertex index. In the example, the X, Y and 
    Z values of the first vertex are mapped to UV coordinate 0,0 - this is because 
    &quot;x0, y0, z0&quot; was specified. A specification of &quot;x0, y2, z0&quot; 
    will use the X and Z values from vertex 0, but the Y value from vertex 2. 
    This way you can specify coordinates outside of the wall/polygon's range. 
    Here's an easier way to see the example:</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">x0, y0, z0 
    -&gt; 0, 0<br>
    x1, y1, z1 -&gt; 1, 0<br>
    x2, y2, z2 -&gt; 1, 1</font></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>o. ResetTextureMapping</strong> - resets the texture 
    mapping parameters to either the default or previous values<br>
    Syntax:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> ResetTextureMapping 
    = default</font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ResetTextureMapping 
     = true </font></p>
  <p align="left">If <em>default</em> is true, the texture mapping values are 
    reset to the default, which is shown above in the SetTextureMapping's example. 
    If <em>default</em> is false, the previous values will be loaded and used.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>p. ReverseAxis</strong> - reverses the axis that the 
    difference in altitude/voffset for floors corresponds to. In the AddFloor 
    command, there are parameters for specifying two different altitudes. By default, 
    if the altitudes are different, the floor will angle upward/downward along 
    the Z axis (front/back), but if this is set to true, the floor will angle 
    along the X axis (left/right).<br>

  <p align="left"> <strong>q. ShaftCut</strong> - used in conjunction with a shaft 
    object - performs a vertical box cut on all floor objects (floors, ceilings, 
    interfloor, etc) in the specified range.<br>
    Syntax:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> ShaftCut number, 
    startx, startz, endx, endz, start_voffset, end_voffset</font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ShaftCut 1, -4, 
    -3.5, 4, 3.5, 0, 5</font></p>
  <p align="left"><em>Number</em> is the number of the shaft object to work with. 
    <em>Startx</em>, <em>startz</em>, <em>endx</em>, and <em>endz</em> are two 
    sets of coordinates that specify the cut box's start position and end position, 
    relative to the shaft's central position. <em>Start_voffset</em> is the position 
    above the starting floor's altitude to start the cut at, and <em>end_voffset</em> 
    is the position above the ending floor's altitude to end the cut at. The example 
    cuts a box for shaft 1, with a width from -4 to 4, and a length from -3.5 
    to 3.5, starting at the starting floor's altitude, and ending at 5 feet above 
    the ending floor's altitude.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>r. CutStairwell</strong> - used in conjunction with 
    a stairwell object - performs a vertical box cut on all floor objects (floors, 
    ceilings, interfloor, etc) in the specified range. For the parameters, see 
    the ShaftCut command.<strong><br>
    </strong>Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CutStairwell 
    number, startx, startz, endx, endz, start_voffset, end_voffset</font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CutStairwell 1, 
    -4, -3.5, 4, 3.5, 0, 5</font></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>s. Isect</strong> - the Isect function calculates the 
    position that a line intersects with a certain object, such as a floor. Since 
    this is a function, it can be used in-line anywhere.<br>
    Syntax:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> isect(destobject, 
    objectname, startx, starty, startz, endx, endy, endz)</font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">isect(external, 
    wall1, 10, 10, 0, -10, 10, 0)</font></p>
  <p align="left"><em>Destobject</em> is the destination object to get the object 
    from (floor, external, landscape, or buildings). <em>Startx</em>, <em>starty</em>, 
    and <em>startz</em> make up the position of the starting position, and <em>endx</em>, 
    <em>endy</em> and <em>endz</em> make up the ending position. The first intersection 
    of the named object is the return value, in &quot;X, Y, Z&quot; format (for 
    example, &quot;10, 1, 3&quot;).</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>t. SetAutoSize</strong> - enables or disables texture 
    autosizing<br>
    Syntax:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> SetAutoSize = <em>AutoWidth, 
    AutoHeight </em></font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">SetAutoSize = true, 
    true</font></p>
  <p align="left">This command will determine if the simulator should automatically 
    size texture appropriately when applied to an object, such as a wall or floor. 
    By default, both are enabled. The <em>AutoWidth</em> and <em>AutoHeight</em> 
    parameters correspond to the &quot;<em>tw</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>th</em>&quot; 
    parameters of the <em>AddWall</em>, <em>AddFloor</em>, etc commands. If any 
    are false, then the parameters specified in the <em>AddWall</em> etc commands 
    multiply the texture values stored with with the <em>Load</em> or <em>LoadRange</em> 
    commands (see below); those values relate to the number of times a texture 
    is tiled; so if <em>AutoHeight</em> is set to False, &quot;2&quot; is specified 
    in the &quot;<em>th</em>&quot; value of <em>AddWall</em>, and the texture's 
    stored &quot;th&quot; value is 1, then the texture will be tiled twice vertically. 
    If either are true, the specified value will me multiplied by the related 
    stored texture value and then autoadjusted.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>u. TextureOverride</strong> - overrides textures for 
    the next command. Currently only works with the different AddWall, AddFloor 
    and AddInterFloor commands.<br>
    Syntax:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> TextureOverride <em>MainNegativeTex, 
    MainPositiveTex, SideNegativeTex, SidePositiveTex, TopTex, Bottom</em></font><font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><em>Tex</em></font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">TextureOverride 
    Metal1, ElevFloor, Metal1, Metal1, Metal1, Metal1</font></p>
  <p align="left">This command will allow you to specify multiple textures for 
    a single command such as AddWall. It will only work on the command immediately 
    after this one. In the above example, the Main Positive side of the object 
    will have the texture &quot;ElevFloor&quot;, but all other sides will use 
    &quot;Metal1&quot;.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>v. ShaftShowFloors</strong> - allows a range of floors 
    to be shown either while inside the specified shaft or while inside an elevator 
    in the shaft - primarily for glass elevators.<br>
    Syntax:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> ShaftShowFloors <em>ShaftNumber</em> 
    = <em>range/list</em></font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ShaftShowFloors 
    1 = 1 - 10</font></p>
  <p align="left">In the above example, let's say the user is in an elevator in 
    shaft 1, and is moving upwards from the 2nd floor. In this situation, the 
    2nd floor will be visible/enabled while they're in the elevator (since it 
    was in the range specified with this command), but when they reach the 11th 
    floor, that floor will be invisible/disabled.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>w. ShaftShowOutside</strong> - allows objects outside 
    the building (sky, landscape, etc) to be enabled while the user is both inside 
    the specified shaft and on one of the specified floors - primarily for glass 
    elevators.<br>
    Syntax:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> ShowShaftOutside 
    <em>ShaftNumber</em> = <em>range/list</em></font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ShowShaftOutside 
    1 = 1 - 10</font></p>
  <p align="left">In the above example, if a user is riding an elevator in shaft 
    1, the outside (sky, landscape, etc) will be enabled while the elevator is 
    on any of the floors from 1 to 10. Once the elevator reaches the 11th floor, 
    the outside will be disabled. This command can be mixed with <em>ShaftShowFloors</em> 
    for mixed atrium/external glass elevators such as the ones in the Glass Tower, 
    where the elevator moves upwards through an indoor atrium, and eventually 
    outside above the atrium. In that situation, the floors that comprise the 
    lower (atrium) section would be specified using <em>ShaftShowFloors</em> (such 
    as 1-10), while the upper (outdoor) floors would be specified using <em>ShaftShowOutside</em> 
    (such as 11-20).</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>x. ShowFullShaft</strong> - determines if an entire 
    shaft should always be shown, such as a glass elevator track.<br>
    Syntax:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> ShowFullShaft <em>ShaftNumber</em> 
    = <em>value</em></font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ShowFullShaft 1 
    = true</font></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>y. TextureFlip</strong> - flips specified textures for 
    the next command.. Currently only works with the different AddWall, AddFloor 
    and AddInterFloor commands. The values available are 0 for no flipping, 1 
    for horizontal flip, 2 for vertical flip, and 3 for both horizontal and vertical.<br>
    Syntax:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> TextureFlip <em>MainNegative, 
    MainPositive, SideNegative, SidePositive, Top, Bottom</em></font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">TextureFlip 1, 1, 
    0, 0, 0, 0</font></p>
  <p align="left">This command will allow you to flip textures on specific parts 
    of a wall or floor created with a command such as AddWall. It will only work 
    on the command immediately after this one. In the above example, the Main 
    Positive and Main Negative sides of the object will have their textures flipped 
    horizontally.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>z. Cut</strong> - performs a manual box cut on an object<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Cut <em>destobject</em>, 
    x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, cutwalls, cutfloors<br>
    </font>Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Cut external, 
    -5, -5, -5, 5, 5, 5, false, true</font></p>
  <p align="left">The x, y and z values specify the start and end coordinates 
    of the box cut. If cutwalls is true, the function will cut walls; if cutfloors 
    is true, it'll cut floors.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>aa. Mount</strong> - mounts a zip file in the data directory 
    into a virtual path.<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Mount <em>filename</em>, 
    <em>path</em></font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Mount myfile.zip, 
    mydirectory</font></p>
  <p align="left">In this example, the file myfile.zip located in Skyscraper's 
    data directory will be mounted as &quot;mydirectory&quot;, and so a file such 
    as test.jpg inside that zip file will appear as &quot;mydirectory/test.jpg&quot;.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>ab. AddFloorAutoArea</strong> - defines an area that 
    will automatically enable and disable floors when the user moves within it, 
    similar to a stairwell<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddFloorAutoArea 
    <em>x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2</em></font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddFloorAutoArea 
    -100, 0, -100, 100, 100, 100</font></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>ac. AddSound</strong> - creates a user-defined looping 
    sound at the specified position<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddSound <em>name, 
    filename, x, y, z[, volume, speed, min_distance, max_distance, dir_radiation, 
    direction_x, direction_y, direction_z]</em></font><br>
    Example 1: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddSound MySound, 
    data/sound.wav, 10, 100, 5<br>
    </font>Example 2: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddSound 
    MySound, data/sound.wav, 10, 100, 5, 1, 100, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0</font></p>
  <p align="left">This command creates a custom sound in the specified position, 
    and has a number of optional parameters - the defaults for the optional parameters 
    are shown in Example 2. If you're going to use any of the optional parameters, 
    you must specify them all. <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em> and <em>Z</em> specify the 
    location in 3D space that the sound will be at, <em>volume</em> specifies 
    the volume percentage (with 1.0 being 100%) of the sound, <em>speed</em> determines 
    the playback speed of the sound in percent, <em>min_distance</em> and <em>max_distance</em> 
    set the minimum and maximum distances that the sound can be heard at full 
    volume - by default, minimum is 1 and maximum is -1. <em>Dir_radiation</em> 
    specifies the directional radiation of the sound in radians (more info below), 
    and <em>direction_x</em>, <em>direction_y</em> and <em>direction_z</em> specify 
    the direction of the sound cone.</p>
  <p align="left"> From the Crystal Space docs on directional radiation:<br>
    &quot;The directional radiation applies to sound that are oriented in a particular 
    direction. This value is expressed in radians and describes the half-angle 
    of a cone spreading from the position of the source and opening in the direction 
    of the source. Set this value to 0.0 for an omni-directional sound.&quot;</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>ad. GetWallExtents</strong> - the GetWallExtents command 
    returns the X and Z extents (minimum and maximum values) of a wall, at the 
    specified altitude. The command will return the results in the ExtentX and 
    ExtentZ variables.<br>
    Syntax:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> GetWallExtents destobject, 
    wallname, altitude, get_maximum</font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">GetWallExtents external, 
    wall1:front, 10, false</font></p>
  <p align="left">Then to use the values:<br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Set 2 = %extentx%</font></p>
  <p align="left"><em>Destobject</em> is the destination object to get the object 
    from (floor, external, landscape, or buildings). <em>Wallname </em>specifies 
    the name of the wall to get the extents from. Generally this should be in 
    the form of &quot;name:side&quot;, but if you leave out the &quot;side&quot; 
    parameter, it'll choose one of the sides from a pre-defined search list. Sides 
    of walls made from any AddWall command generally have &quot;front&quot;, &quot;back&quot;, 
    &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; sides. Walls made using AddCustomWall 
    and AddTriangleWall have sides of &quot;0&quot; (front) and &quot;1&quot; 
    (back), so with those you'd specify &quot;name:0&quot; for the front. <em>Altitude</em> 
    specifies the altitude to use for the check - basically it makes a copy of 
    the wall, cuts it down to a line at that altitude, and returns the coordinates 
    of the endpoints. <em>Get_maximum</em> specifies if the function should return 
    the maximum or minimum coordinates. The command will store the results in 
    the ExtentsX and ExtentsZ variables, which can be used anywhere in the script 
    - to get the X result, you'd use %extentx%.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>ae. Print</strong> - prints the contents of a line to 
    the console. This command will still convert variables and even math expressions, 
    and output the results.<br>
    Syntax:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"> Print text</font><br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Print 1+1</font></p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>7. END command</strong></p>
  <p align="left">The End command tells the software to stop processing the current 
    script and start the simulation. This is optional.<br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;end&gt;</font></p>
  <p align="left"><br>
    <strong>8. BREAK command</strong></p>
  <p align="left">The Break command triggers a break section in the script processor, 
    and is used when running the simulator in debug mode. A debugger breakpoint 
    can be set on the associated line in fileio.cpp, and when this command is 
    called, the debugger will hit the breakpoint.<br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;break&gt;</font></p>

  <p align="left"><strong>1. Load</strong> - loads a texture<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Load <em>filename</em>, 
    <em>name</em>, <em>tile_x</em>, <em>tile_y[, force</em></font>]<br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Load data\brick1.jpg, 
    Brick, 1, 1</font></p>
  <p align="left">This example will load the file brick.jpg and name it Brick. 
    The values <em>tile_x</em> and <em>tile_y</em> are per-texture multipliers. 
    For example, if you set <em>tile_x</em> to 2, and you specify a texture width 
    (tw) of 2 during an <em>AddFloor</em> command later, the tiling value will 
    be 4 (2 times 2), and the texture will be repeated 4 times horizontally. The 
    <em>force</em> value is optional, and if set to false, autosizing will always 
    be disabled for this texture; if set to true, autosizing will always be enabled.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>2. LoadRange</strong> - loads a numeric 
    range of textures, and the current number is available in the <em>number</em> 
    variable (<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">%number%</font>)<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">LoadRange <em>startnumber</em>,

  <p align="left">This example will load the file 2.jpg and name it Button2, 3.jpg 
    as Button3, and so on. The values <em>tile_x</em> and <em>tile_y</em> are 
    per-texture multipliers. For example, if you set <em>tile_x</em> to 2, and 
    you specify a texture width (tw) of 2 during an <em>AddFloor</em> command 
    later, the tiling value will be 4 (2 times 2), and the texture will be repeated 
    4 times horizontally. The <em>force</em> value is optional, and if set to 
    false, autosizing will always be disabled for this texture; if set to true, 
    autosizing will always be enabled.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>3. AddText</strong> - draws text onto a texture - this 
    only creates a new texture during runtime (in memory), and all changes are 
    lost when the application shuts down<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddText texture_name, 
    name, font_filename, font_size, text, x1, y1, x2, y2, h_align, v_align, ColorR,

    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddText Black, Button100, 
    nimbus_sans.ttf, 47, 100, -1, -1, -1, -1, center, center, 255, 255, 255</font></p>
  <p align="left">With this command, texture_name is the name of the previously 
    loaded texture to draw text onto (loaded with either Load or LoadRange). Name 
    is the name to call this new texture. Font_filename is the filename of the 
    font to use - fonts are in Skyscraper's data/fonts directory. X1, y1, x2, 
    and y2 are coordinate values mainly used to position the text in a boxed area, 
    with the position of 0, 0 (x 0, y 0) being on the top left.. If any value 
    is -1, the dimension of the texture will be used (so in this example, the 
    loaded texture has a size of 128x128 pixels, and so the values are 0, 0, 128, 
    128). This will place the text in the center of the texture image, but to 
    position it elsewhere, specify the pixel box to place it in. H_align and v_align 
    determine the alignment of the text - for h_align, it can either be &quot;left&quot;, 
    &quot;right&quot; or &quot;center&quot;, and for v_align either &quot;top&quot;, 
    &quot;bottom&quot; or &quot;center&quot;. ColorR, ColorG and ColorB determine 
    the color of the text, and the values range from 0 to 255. If all values are 
    255, the text is white, and if all values are 0, then it's black. The <em>force</em> 
    value is optional, and if set to false, autosizing will always be disabled 
    for this texture; if set to true, autosizing will always be enabled.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>4. AddTextRange</strong> - similar to LoadRange, but 
    draws text onto a texture<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddText startnumber,

    Brick2, 10, 10, 20, 20, 1, 1</font></p>
  <p align="left">This command is similar to the Load command, but loads only 
    a portion of an image. In the above example, the command loads the file data\brick1.jpg 
    as &quot;Brick2&quot;, but only loads the portion of the image starting at 
    pixel 10, 10, with a width of 20 pixels and a heigth of 20 pixels. Pixel 0, 
    0 is on the top left of the image. The <em>force</em> value is optional, and 
    if set to false, autosizing will always be disabled for this texture; if set 
    to true, autosizing will always be enabled.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>6. AddOverlay</strong> - draws an image on top of another

    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddOverlay Brick1, 
    Brick2, NewBrick, 25, 25, 50, 50, 1, 1</font></p>
  <p align="left">This command allows multiple textures to be combined into a 
    single texture, by drawing one on top of the other. <em>Texture_name</em> 
    specifies the original source texture name to use (all textures must be loaded 
    beforehand), <em>overlay_texture_name</em> specifies the texture to draw on 
    top of the source texture, and <em>name</em> specifies the name of the new 
    texture. X and Y determine the position to place the top-left of the new image 
    at (since position 0, 0 is the top left of the image), and width and height 
    determine the size in pixels of the overlay texture. In the above example, 
    the &quot;Brick2&quot; texture is drawn on top of the &quot;Brick1&quot; texture, 
    starting at pixel position 25, 25, with a width of 50 and a height of 50. 
    The resulting texture is called &quot;NewBrick&quot;. The <em>force</em> value 
    is optional, and if set to false, autosizing will always be disabled for this 
    texture; if set to true, autosizing will always be enabled.</p>

  <p align="left"><strong><font size="+1">5. The <em>Floor</em> Sections</font></strong></p>
  <p align="left">There are 2 <em>Floor</em> sections available - <em>Floor</em> 
    and <em>Floors</em>. <em>Floor</em> specifies a single floor, while <em>Floors</em> 
    specifies a range of floors.<br>
    For a single floor, the section would start with this:<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;Floor <em>number</em>&gt;</font><br>
    and end with this:<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;EndFloor&gt;</font><br>
    For example, a floor section for a lobby would use this:<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;Floor 0&gt;</font></p>
  <p align="left">For multiple floors, the section would start with this:<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;Floors <em>start</em> 
    to <em>finish</em>&gt;</font><br>
    and end with this:<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;EndFloors&gt;<br>
    </font>For example, to work with floors 5-10, you would type:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><br>
    &lt;Floors 5 to 10&gt;</font></p>
  <p align="left">Floors above ground start with 0 (so a 15-story building would 
    have floors 0-14). Also, floors must be made in the proper order: basement 
    levels must be made first in decending order (-1, -2, -3 etc), and then above-ground 
    floors in ascending order (0, 1, 2, etc).</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Variables:</strong></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><strong>%floor%</strong></font> 
    - contains the current floor number<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><strong>%height%</strong></font> 
    - contains the current floor's ceiling height<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><strong>%interfloorheight%</strong></font> 
    - contains the current floor's interfloor height (spacing between floors)<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><strong>%fullheight%</strong></font> 
    - contains the current floor's total height, including the interfloor height<br>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Parameters:</strong></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>1. Name</strong> - the name of the current floor, required<br>
    Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Name = Floor %floor%</font></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>2. ID</strong> - the floor indicator name for the current 
    floor, such as L (for Lobby), LL (lower level), M (Mezzanine), etc. This is 
    also used to determine what texture should be loaded for the elevator floor 
    indicators and floor signs. The texture name would be &quot;Button[ID]&quot; 
    - so if the ID is 10, the texture name would be &quot;Button10&quot;.<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ID = %floor%</font></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>3. Type</strong> - the type of floor the current floor 
    is. The types are still being defined, but the currently used ones are Basement, 
    Lobby, Mezzanine, Conference, Office, Service, Skylobby, Hotel, Apartment, 
    Condominium, Restaurant, Observatory, Recreation, Ballroom, Communications, 
    and Roof. (Required)<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Type = Office</font></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>4. Description</strong> - description of the current 
    floor, optional<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Description = Offices</font></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>5. Height</strong> - the floor-to-ceiling height of 
    the current floor, required<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Height = 9.5</font></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>6. InterfloorHeight</strong> - the height in feet of 
    the space between floors (below each floor), starting at the floor's altitude, 
    and ending right below the level's floor; required.<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">InterfloorHeight = 2.24</font></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>7. Altitude</strong> - this parameter is optional and 
    is only recommended if the first level has an interfloor area that needs to 
    be below ground. If this parameter is not used, the altitude will be calculated 
    automatically.<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Altitude = -2.24</font></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>8. Group</strong> - group floors together. This is a 
    list of comma-separated floor numbers (or a range specified with the - symbol) 
    that should be enabled along with this floor when the user arrives at this 
    floor. For example, if a 2-story room has a balcony, and the room base and 
    balcony are separate floors, you would specify the other floor's number in 
    this parameter.<br>
    Examples:<br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Group = 5</font><br>
    <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Group = 4, 5<br>

  <p align="left">The <em>direction</em> parameter specifies the direction the 
    staircase faces (where the bottom step is), and so if a staircase goes up 
    from left to right, the direction would be <em>left</em>. <em>Width</em> specifies 
    the step width; <em>risersize</em> specifies the height of each step riser 
    (vertical portion); <em>treadsize</em> specifies the length of each step tread/run 
    (horizontal portion); <em>num_stairs</em> specifies the total number of steps 
    to create (including the above landing platform, but not including the base 
    platform). To calculate the length of the staircase, multiply <em>(num_stairs</em> 
    - 1) with <em>treadsize</em>; in the above example, that would be 9 * 0.5. 
    To determine the height of the staircase, multiply <em>num_stairs</em> with 
    <em>risersize</em>. Note that the tread of the top step is not drawn (the 
    top step is the landing platform); therefore for a staircase containing 10 
    steps, the total staircase width would be comprised of 9 treads (which is 
    why the length calculation used num_stairs minus 1).</p>

  <p align="left">The AddShaftDoor command creates working shaft elevator doors 
    on the current floor only - the other command, <em>AddShaftDoors</em> (in 
    the <em>elevator</em> section) creates all shaft doors in a single command. 
    This command is useful for specifying different textures for shaft doors depending 
    on the floor, and also for only creating shaft doors on one side if an elevator 
    serves a specific floor. The <em>SetShaftDoors</em> command in the elevator 
    section must be used before using this command. Parameters such as width, 
    height, and direction are taken from the <em>AddDoors</em> command (so the 
    regular elevator doors need to be created first). These doors should be moved 
    slightly away from the elevator doors (to separate them both). Also, this 
    command cuts any shaft walls that are within the door area (and so this must 
    be called after the shaft walls are created). <em>Number</em> specifies the 
    number of the door to create (related to the <em>Doors</em> command) - if 
    the elevator only has one door, or if the <em>Doors</em> command was not used, 
    specify 1 here.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>19. AddFloorIndicator</strong> - creates a floor indicator 
    associated with a specific elevator<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddFloorIndicator<em> 
    elevator, relative, texture_prefix, direction, CenterX, CenterZ, width, height, voffset</em></font> 
  </p>
  <p align="left">The AddFloorIndicator command creates a floor indicator at the 
    position specified by <em>CenterX</em> and <em>CenterZ</em>, associated with 
    the elevator specified by <em>elevator</em>. <em>Direction</em> is the direction 
    the indicator faces, and can be either &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, 
    &quot;front&quot; or &quot;back&quot;. <em>Relative</em> determines if the 
    <em>CenterX</em> and <em>CenterZ</em> values are relative of the elevator's 
    center or not. This command can be given multiple times to create multiple 
    indicators.  Texture_prefix is the base name of the texture to load when displaying
    a floor ID; for example if the indicator is on floor 3, and you specify a prefix
    of "Button", it'll load the "Button3" texture.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>20. Cut</strong> - performs a manual box cut on an area 
    within the current floor<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Cut x1, y1, z1, x2, 
    y2, z2, cutwalls, cutfloors<br>
    </font>Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Cut -5, -5, 
    -5, 5, 5, 5, false, true</font></p>
  <p align="left">The x, y and z values specify the start and end coordinates 
    of the box cut. The Y values are relative to the current floor's altitude.. 
    If cutwalls is true, the function will cut walls; if cutfloors is true, it'll 
    cut floors.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>21. AddFillerWalls</strong> - helper function to add 
    fillers around a door's cut location. When a door is created, the wall in 
    it's location is cut to provide space; after the cut, the sides are open (if 
    the wall has thickness) - this creates a covering wall on each side and a 
    floor above the door frame to fill the area.<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddFillerWalls texture, 
    thickness, CenterX, CenterZ, width, height, voffset, direction, tw, th<br>
    </font>Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddFillerWalls 
    ConnectionWall, 0.5, -10, 0, 3.5, 8, 0, true, 0, 0</font></p>
  <p align="left">The parameters in this function are similar to the related door's 
    parameters. Direction is either true if the door faces the front/back (width 
    is along the X axis), or false if the door faces left/right (width is along 
    the Z axis).</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>22. AddSound</strong> - creates a user-defined looping 
    sound at the specified position<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddSound <em>name, 
    filename, x, y, z[, volume, speed, min_distance, max_distance, dir_radiation, 
    direction_x, direction_y, direction_z]</em></font><br>
    Example 1: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddSound MySound, 
    data/sound.wav, 10, 100, 5<br>
    </font>Example 2: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddSound 
    MySound, data/sound.wav, 10, 100, 5, 1, 100, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0</font></p>
  <p align="left">For information on the parameters, see the AddSound command 
    in the Globals section. The only difference here is that the Y value is relative 
    of the floor's base (altitude plus interfloor height).</p>

    x</em>, <em>z</em>, <em>floor<br>
    </em></font>Example:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><em> 
    </em>CreateElevator false, 0, 10, 0</font></p>
  <p align="left"><em>Relative </em>determines if the coordinates are relative 
    to the shaft center, or if they're absolute, <em>X</em> and <em>Z </em>are 
    the coordinates to place the center of the elevator at, and <em>Floor</em> 
    is the floor to place the elevator on.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>2. AddFloor</strong> - adds a textured floor with the 
    specified dimensions for the elevator<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddFloor <em>name, 
    texturename</em>, <em>thickness, x1</em>, <em>z1</em>, <em>x2</em>, <em>z2</em>,

  <p align="left">The elevator's AddWall command is similar to the other AddWall 
    commands.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>4. AddDoors</strong> - creates elevator doors<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddDoors <em>number, 
    lefttexture, righttexture</em>, <em>thickness, CenterX, CenterZ, width, height, direction, 
    tw, th</em></font></p>
  <p align="left">The AddDoors command creates working elevator doors at the central 
    location specified by <em>CenterX</em> and <em>CenterZ</em>, with <em>width</em> 
    and <em>height</em> specifiying the width and height of each door, and <em>Direction</em> 
    specifying the direction that the doors face (currently there are only 2: 
    <em>false</em> if the doors are on the left or right sides, and <em>true</em> 
    if the doors are on the front or back sides). <em>Number</em> specifies the 
    number of the door to create (related to the <em>Doors</em> command) - if 
    the elevator only has one door, or if the Doors command was not used, specify 
    1 here.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>5. AddShaftDoors</strong> - creates shaft elevator doors<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddShaftDoors <em>number, 
    lefttexture, righttexture</em>, <em>thickness, CenterX, CenterZ, tw, th</em></font></p>
  <p align="left">The AddShaftDoors command creates working shaft elevator doors 
    at the central location specified by <em>CenterX</em> and <em>CenterZ</em>. 
    Other parameters such as width, height, and direction are taken from the AddDoors 
    command (so the regular elevator doors need to be created first). These doors 
    should be moved slightly away from the elevator doors (to separate them both). 
    Also, this command creates doors at all the floors specified in the ServicedFloors 
    value, and cuts any shaft walls that are within the door area (and so this 
    must be called after the shaft walls are created). <em>Number</em> specifies 
    the number of the door to create (related to the <em>Doors</em> command) - 
    if the elevator only has one door, or if the Doors command was not used, specify 
    1 here.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>6. CreatePanel</strong> - creates a button panel<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CreatePanel <em>texturename</em>, 
    <em>rows, columns, direction, CenterX, CenterZ, buttonwidth, buttonheight, 
    spacingX, spacingY, voffset, tw, th<br>

    </em><font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CreatePanel Wall1, 5, 
    5, right, -3, -3, 0.15, 0.15, 0.3, 0.45, 4.5, 0, 0</font></font></p>
  <p align="left">The CreatePanel command creates a button panel at a position 
    relative to the elevator's center position (origin). <em>Rows</em> and <em>Columns</em> 
    define the grid size of the panel. <em>Direction</em> is either &quot;front&quot;, 
    &quot;back&quot;, &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot;, defining which direction 
    the panel faces. <em>SpacingX</em> is the space (percent of a button's width) 
    horizontally between each button, and <em>spacingY</em> is the space (percent 
    of a button's height) vertically between each button. Not all positions need 
    to be used; this is simply to provide a grid layout for the panel. This command 
    also determines the width and height of the panel based on the spacing and 
    button sizes. A simple formula for determining panel width or height is this 
    - for width, it's (columns * buttonwidth) + (spacingX * (columns + 1)); for 
    height, just swap columns with rows and spacingX with spacingY.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>7. AddFloorButton</strong> - creates a floor button 
    on the panel<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddFloorButton <em>panel_number, 
    texture_unlit</em>, <em>texture_lit, row, column, floor, width, height[, hoffset,

    Example 1: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddFloorButton 1, Button5, 7, 3, 4, 1, 1</font><br>
    Example 2: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddFloorButton 1, Button5, 7, 3, 4, 1, 1, 0.1, -0.1</font></p> 
  <p align="left">The AddFloorButton command creates a floor button on the button 
    panel created with CreatePanel. Panel_number specifies the number of the panel 
    to add the button to; the number can be either 1 or 2. <em>Row</em> and <em>Column</em> 
    specify the position on the grid where the button should be. <em>Floor</em> 
    specifies the floor number that this button calls. <em>Width</em> and <em>Height</em> 
    specify the width and height of the button, as a percentage of a single grid 
    unit size (1 being 100%, 0.5 being 50%). If both values are 0, the default 
    of 1 is used for both values. If only one of the values is 0, then the exact 
    size other is used; for example, if <em>width</em> is 0 and <em>height</em> 
    is 1 (or any other number), then the width will end up being the same size 
    as the height. <em>Hoffset</em> and <em>Voffset</em> are optional parameters,
    and are used to position the button outside the normal grid, and are in grid units
    (buttonwidth and buttonheight parameters of the CreatePanel function).
    In the second example, the button is positioned 0.1 grid units to the right, and 0.1
    grid units down.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>8. AddControlButton</strong> - creates a control button 
    on the panel<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddControlButton 
    <em>panel_number, texture_unlit</em>, <em>texture_lit, row, column, type, 
    width, height[, hoffset, voffset]</em></font></p>
  <p align="left">The AddControlButton command creates a command button on the 
    panel created with CreatePanel. <em>Row</em> and <em>Column</em> are the same 
    as the AddFloorButton command, and <em>Type</em> can be either &quot;open&quot;, 
    &quot;close&quot;, &quot;cancel&quot;, &quot;stop&quot; or &quot;alarm&quot;. 
    See the above command (AddFloorButton) for a description of the other parameters.</p> 
  <p align="left"><strong>9. AddFloorIndicator</strong> - creates a floor indicator<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddFloorIndicator<em> 
    texture_prefix, direction, CenterX, CenterZ, width, height, voffset</em></font> </p>
  <p align="left">The AddFloorIndicator command creates a floor indicator at the 
    position (relative to the elevator) specified by <em>CenterX</em> and <em>CenterZ</em>. 
    <em>Direction</em> is the direction the indicator faces, and can be either 
    &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, &quot;front&quot; or &quot;back&quot;. 
    This command can be given multiple times to create multiple indicators.
    Texture_prefix is the base name of the texture to load when displaying
    a floor ID; for example if the elevator is on floor 3, and you specify a prefix
    of "Button", it'll load the "Button3" texture.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>10. AddDirectionalIndicators</strong> - creates the 
    elevator's directional indicator/lanterns (similar to the CreateCallButtons 
    command) <br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddDirectionalIndicators<em> 
    Relative, Single, Vertical, BackTexture</em>, <em>UpTexture</em>, <em>UpTextureLit, DownTexture, 
    DownTextureLit, CenterX, CenterZ, voffset, direction, BackWidth, BackHeight, 
    ShowBack, tw, th<br>
    </em></font>Example:<font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono"><em> 
    AddDirectionalIndicators true, false, true, Metal, UpLight, UpLightOn, DownLight, DownLightOn, 
    -3, -4.162, 6, front, 0.5, 1, true, 0, 0</em></font></p>
  <p align="left">This command will create directional indicators on all floors 
    the elevator serves. It'll also automatically create the up and down lights 
    depending on the floor. To create indicators on a per-floor basis, use the AddDirectionalIndicator command in the Floor section.</p>
  <p align="left"><em>Relative</em> determines if the X and Z coordinates are
      relative to the elevator's origin (center) or not.</p>
  <p align="left"><em>Single</em> determines if a single indicator light should be created instead of two.  If this is true, the unlit texture is specified in <em>UpLight</em>, and the <em>DownLight</em> value is ignored.</p>
  <p align="left"><em>Vertical</em> determines if the two lights should be vertically separated (true), or horizontally separated (false)</p>
  <p align="left"><em>BackTexture</em> is the texture of the wall plate behind 
    the lights</p>
  <p align="left"><em>UpTexture</em> and <em>DownTexture</em> are the textures 
    used for the lights themselves, and the &quot;Lit&quot; texures are the ones 
    to show when the light is on.  <em>DownTexture</em> is ignored if <em>Single</em> is true.</p>
  <p align="left"><em>CenterX</em> and <em>CenterZ</em> are the central location 
    of the indicators</p>
  <p align="left"><em>voffset</em> is the altitude offset that the object is above 
    each floor</p>
  <p align="left"><em>direction </em>determines the direction the indicators face:<br>
    'front' means they face towards the front of the building<br>
    'back' means they face towards the back of the building<br>
    'left' means they face left<br>
    'right' means they face right</p>
  <p align="left"><em>BackWidth</em> and <em>BackHeight</em> are the width and 
    height of the wall plate</p>
  <p align="left"><em>ShowBack</em> determines if the wall plate should be shown, 
    and is either true or false</p>
  <p align="left"><em>tw</em> and <em>th</em> are the texture scaling for the 
    wall plate.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>11. SetShaftDoors</strong> - sets positioning and thickness 
    of shaft doors which will be created with the <em>AddShaftDoor</em> command<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">SetShaftDoors<em> 
    number</em>, <em>thickness, CenterX, CenterZ</em></font> </p>
  <p align="left">This command must be used before calling <em>AddShaftDoor</em>. 
    This specifies the thickness and X/Z positioning for the shaft doors that 
    will be created. <em>Number</em> specifies the door number this is associated 
    with (use 1 if only one door).</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>12. AddFloorSigns</strong> - creates floor signs on 
    all floors serviced by the elevator<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddFloorSigns<em> 
    door_number, relative, texture_prefix, direction, CenterX, CenterZ, width, 
    height, voffset</em></font> </p>
  <p align="left">The AddFloorSigns command creates floor signs (similar to floor 
    indicators) on all the floors serviced by the current elevator. Direction 
    is the direction the signs face, and can be either &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, 
    &quot;front&quot; or &quot;back&quot;. Texture_prefix is the base name of 
    the texture to load when displaying a floor ID; for example if the sign is 
    on floor 3, and you specify a prefix of "Button", it'll load the "Button3" 
    texture. Door_number specifies the door number to check against, meaning if 
    shaft doors don't exist on a certain floor for the specified door, the sign 
    won't be created on that floor. This can be bypassed by setting door_number 
    to 0.</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>13. AddSound</strong> - creates a user-defined looping 
    sound at the specified position<br>
    Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddSound <em>name, 
    filename, x, y, z[, volume, speed, min_distance, max_distance, dir_radiation, 
    direction_x, direction_y, direction_z]</em></font><br>
    Example 1: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddSound MySound, 
    data/sound.wav, 10, 100, 5<br>
    </font>Example 2: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">AddSound 
    MySound, data/sound.wav, 10, 100, 5, 1, 100, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0</font></p>
  <p align="left">For information on the parameters, see the AddSound command 
    in the Globals section. The only difference here is that the X, Y and Z position 
    values are relative of the elevator's center/origin.</p>
