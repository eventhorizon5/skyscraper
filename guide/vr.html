      <p align="left">Skyscraper has experimental virtual reality
        support, that has been tested on a Meta Quest 2 headset.&nbsp;
        Since only graphics are supported and not the controllers that
        come with the headset, third-party game controllers are
        recommended.&nbsp; The following photo shows the Quest 2 headset
        I've used for simulator development and it's controller.<br>

      To enable virtual reality support, open up the skyscraper.ini file
      in a text editor, and change the line that reads
      "Skyscraper.Frontend.VR = false" to true:<br>
      <br>
      <table width="800" height="42" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2"
        border="1">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td valign="top" bgcolor="#e0e0e0">
              <div align="left"><font face="Courier New, Courier,
                  monospace"><font size="-1">;enable or disable VR mode</font></font><br>
              </div>
              <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace"><font
                  size="-1">Skyscraper.Frontend.VR = true</font><br>
              </font></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <br>
      Once that is changed, you'll need to make sure DirectX 11 support
      is enabled.&nbsp; To do that, delete the ogre.cfg file in
      Skyscraper's folder, and choose DirectX 11 when launching
      Skyscraper.&nbsp; Connect your game controller and optionally your
      headset, and launch Skyscraper.&nbsp; If you don't plug in your
      headset beforehand, it'll report about a headset not being found.<br>
      <br>
      Both link cables and airlink are supported.&nbsp; Connect your
      headset, and if things are working properly, you'll see the
      building selection menu.&nbsp; You might need to enable the link
      support from the headset.<br>
      <br>
      The building I normally choose is the City Demo.&nbsp; It should
      take a minute to load, once it's loaded, you should see Skyscraper
      in full immersive VR.<br>
      <br>
      Currently, to control things such as elevators, you'll need to use
      the control panel windows.&nbsp; Things such as movement, jumping,
      opening doors, and running can be done with the controller.&nbsp;
      Other things such as turning off collisions (v key) can be done
      via the keyboard.<br>
