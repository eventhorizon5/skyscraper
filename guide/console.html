    <div align="center">The Console is an interface to both Virtual
      Manager, and the Script Processor.&nbsp; Virtual Manager allows
      you to manage<br>
      the overall simulator itself, such as creating and deleting
      simulator engines.&nbsp; The Script Processor allows you to<br>
      manage the simulator environment, from a single simulator
      instance, such as creating walls and floors.<br>

        The console output will appear in the window, and will appear in
        different colors if your operating system supports it.<br>
        Type commands into the box on the bottom, and click <i>Send</i>
        to send them to the simulator.<br>
        The <i>Clear</i> button clears the text scrollback.&nbsp; The <i>Echo</i>
        checkbox determines if the user's commands should be shown in
        the console output.<br>
        <br>
        Please note that VM currently only supports single lines at a
        time, while the script processor supports multiple lines.<br>
        <br>
        For a list of commands that VM supports, type "help" and click
        Send.<br>
        <br>
        For the script commands, see the script guide.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        On Linux and Mac systems, the console can be switched off via
        the INI file (skyscraper.ini), and the output will show up in a
        terminal instead.<br>
