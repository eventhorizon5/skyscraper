      Skyscraper's Sound Manager gives you full control over the sound
      in the simulator.<br>
      <img moz-do-not-send="true" src="soundman.jpg" alt="Sound Manager"
        width="756" height="545"><br>
      <br>
      On the left, the filenames of each loaded sound are shown.&nbsp;
      When you click on a filename,<br>
      the sound handles associated with that filename are shown in the
      center.<br>
      <br>
      Length is the length in seconds of the sound file.<br>
      <br>
      The Position box displays the sound's position in 3D space, and
      can be moved by clicking the Move button<br>
      <br>
      Valid volume values are from 0 to 1, so 0.5 would be 50%.<br>
      <br>
      The Enabled option allows for disabling of sounds in situations
      where they won't turn off, such as elevator motors.<br>
      <br>
      The Cleanup button deletes any handles or sound files that are
      unused, to free up memory and resources.<br>
      <br>
      List Playing Sounds lists on the console all of the playing sounds
      in this simulator instance,<br>
      and next to it is a button that lists all playing sounds in all
      simulator instances.<br>
