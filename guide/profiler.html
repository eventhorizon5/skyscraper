      VM is the root of the simulator, with VM's subsystems next
      ("Engines" refers to the Engine Contexts system), and SBS is the
      simulator engine with it's subsystems.<br>
      <br>
      You will notice "1 calls" for each item, this will usually be the
      number of simulators loaded (sim engine instances).<br>
      <br>
      Each iteration of the profiler is a per-frame statistic.&nbsp; The
      running times are the amount of time running since last frame.<br>
