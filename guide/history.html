      href="https://www.skyscrapersim.net">The Skyscraper Project
      (SkyscraperSim</a>) was started in December 2002 by Ryan Thoryk,
    after designing a 138-story building known as the Triton
    Center.&nbsp; The software MyHouse 3D was being used to simulate it
    and produce the floor plans, and something much better was required
    for realism and scalability, so Skyscraper was born.&nbsp;
    Skyscraper was an idea conceived during an internship position at
    Argonne National Laboratory, and originally was written in the
    Visual Basic 6 language, along with the TrueVision3D game/graphics
    engine.<br>
    <br>
    Skyscraper 1.0 was released on July 21, 2004 as a first-person 3D
    simulation of a single building, the Triton Center.&nbsp; The
    interior of the building was very simplistic in this version, the
    more standard design that users are familiar with was designed
    later, mainly in 2005.&nbsp; Right before the 1.0 release, the 0.97
    development version was being worked on, but the changes were too
    extreme, so the 0.96 code was cleaned up and released as 1.0.&nbsp;
    Skyscraper 0.97 (May 2004) was renamed 1.1 (in July 2004), and
    development continued on this version, still in the Visual Basic
    language.&nbsp; The main difference between 0.96 and 0.97, was that
    0.96 could only simulate a single building, while 0.97 was the
    beginning of a simulator that could load multiple, eventually
    through a scripting language.&nbsp; The internal simulator engine
    that it used needed a name, originally it was called Scalable
    Building Simulation Engine (SBSE), later shortened to just Scalable
    Building Simulator, or SBS.<br>
    <br>
    In June 2005, the C++ version was born, after selecting C++ as the
    language (out of C++, Java and C#), and Crystal Space as the
    graphics/game engine. &nbsp; wxWidgets was chosen as the GUI
    frontend.&nbsp; Skyscraper 2.0 Alpha 1 was released on January 6,
    2009, the first public release of the simulator.&nbsp; This time saw
    Skyscraper become truly multiplatform, becoming available for
    Windows, Mac and Linux, with partially-working ports to operating
    systems such as IRIX still existing.&nbsp; It also saw the creation
    of the original Skyscraper Simulator Forum.&nbsp; In 2010, the
    primary part of Crystal Space that Skyscraper was using, the
    ThingMesh system, was removed, and so plans were put in place to
    eventually port Skyscraper over to a new graphics engine.&nbsp; The
    ThingMesh system was redesigned into a more simplified form and
    implemented as the PolyMesh system in Skyscraper; this made porting
    Skyscraper much easier.&nbsp; The Ogre graphics engine was chosen,
    with porting underway starting in November 2010 during the Alpha 8
    development cycle, making Alpha 7 the last major release of the
    Crystal Space engine (the last build being from 2010 taken from the
    Alpha 8 codebase).&nbsp; On March 1, 2013, Skyscraper 2.0 Alpha 8
    was released, the first major release of the simulator's Ogre
    port.&nbsp; In 2016, the Engine Contexts feature was developed,
    introducing the ability to have multiple buildings running together
    in a single simulation environment.&nbsp; This evolved into Virtual
    Manager.&nbsp; In 2023, Destination Dispatch elevator support was
    created.&nbsp; In mid 2024 the status was switched to Beta, and then
    eventually in 2025, 2.0 release candidates were released.<br>
    <br>
    Skyscraper 2.0 is the culmination of development from the original
    0.97 version from 2004, which classifies as a rewrite, and the C++
    version started in 2005, to the new 2.0 in 2025.&nbsp; Eleven public
    Alpha releases were put out in total, each one being pseudo-stable.<br>
