      <p><strong><font size="+2">The Buildings Section</font></strong><br>
      </p>
      <hr>
      <div align="center">
        <p align="left">The <em>Buildings</em> section allows you to
          load additional buildings, into separate simulation engines,
          and have them all be visible and usable in the same scene.
          This section is small, and mainly exists to provide clarity in
          scripts. Additional buildings also have their own script
          interpreters, so their scripts (and things such as includes)
          are completely isolated from each other. Note that this
          section is skipped when reloading the building (Ctrl-R). This
          section should be placed at the beginning of the script file,
          so that the progress bar during load can be accurate. When the
          script is finished loading, the primary building (the one
          included in the main script) will be automatically cut for
          each child building (using the section's Cut parameters),
          making it easy to integrate new buildings into existing spaces
          with large landscapes, or even city blocks. Nesting of this
          section is also supported, so that if a child building also
          has a buildings section, it'll process it, and the parent
          building will be cut for each child building.<br>
          <br>
          The section starts with this header:<br>
          <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;Buildings&gt;</font></p>
        <p align="left">and ends with this footer:<br>
          <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;EndBuildings&gt;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><strong>Parameters (all are optional):</strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong>1. ConcurrentLoads</strong> - if this is
          set to true, load all buildings simultaneously. Default is
          false, which loads each building in order.<br>
          Example: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">ConcurrentLoads










































            = true</font></p>
        <p align="left"><strong>2. CutLandscape</strong> - if this is
          set to true, cut the Landscape mesh of buildings, discarding
          the area outside of the building's set boundaries. Default is
          true<br>
          <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CutLandscape
            = true</font><br>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><strong>3. CutBuildings</strong> - if this is
          set to true, cut the Buildings mesh of buildings, discarding
          the area outside of the building's set boundaries. Default is
          true<br>
          <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CutBuildings
            = true</font><br>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><strong>4. CutExternal</strong> - if this is set
          to true, cut the External mesh of buildings, discarding the
          area outside of the building's set boundaries. Default is
          false, since this may have an unnecessary performance impact<br>
          <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CutExternal =
            true</font><br>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><strong>5. CutFloors</strong> - if this is set
          to true, cut the Floors meshes of buildings, discarding the
          area outside of the building's set boundaries. Default is
          false, since this may have an unnecessary performance impact<br>
          <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">CutFloors =
            true</font><br>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><strong>Commands:</strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong>1. Load</strong> - load a building,
          creating a new Engine Context (script interpreter and sim
          engine pair) for it. This command requires a building filename
          to be specified, and optionally allows the position to be set
          (which overrides the Position value in that building's Globals
          section), the rotation (Y axis, which is left/right) in
          degrees to be set, and the bounds values to be set (which also
          overrides the building's Bounds value). For the rotation
          value, if "90" is specified, the building is rotated so that
          it faces the right. If the value is "270" or "-90", the
          building faces the left. The Bounds values are used to
          determine the position limits of what are considered that
          building, where if a building has a position X value of 200,
          and the MinX is -100 and MaxX is 100, the global positions of
          100X to 300X are "inside" that building's space (200 - 100,
          and 200 + 100). Subfolders are supported, so a filename of
          "myfolder/mybuilding.bld" will load the building file at
          "buildings/myfolder/mybuilding.bld".<br>
          <br>
          Syntax: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Load
            <em>filename</em>[, <em>X, Y, Z, Rotation</em>][, <em>MinX,










































              MinY, MinZ, MaxX, MaxY, MaxZ</em>]</font><br>
          Example 1: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Load

          Example 2: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Load










































            Simple.bld, 200, 0, 200, 0</font><br>
          Example 3: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Load










































            Simple.bld, 200, 0, 200, 0, -100, 0, -100, 100, 0, 100</font><br>
          Example 4: <font size="2" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Load
