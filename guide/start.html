      <div align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buildings are stored in text
        files in Skyscraper's <em>buildings</em> folder, usually at
        "c:\program files\skyscraper\buildings" on Windows, or in the
        "buildings" directory on Unix. The filenames end in BLD, and so
        you need to make sure your text file ends with ".bld" and not
        ".txt". To create a new building, the easiest way is to modify
        the Simple building, which is a new building tutorial.&nbsp;
        Copy the Simple.bld file, which is found in the "buildings"
        folder, into another file, such as MyBuilding.bld.&nbsp; When
        you're finished, save your building and run the simulator. The
        building will appear when you choose "Other buildings..." in
        Skyscraper's main menu. You might also want to open one of the
        other buildings that come with Skyscraper ("Triton Center.bld",
        "Glass Tower.bld", etc) for examples on the more advanced
        functions. Please note that the script syntax might change in
        the future.<br>

      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To see an example of a small
        simplistic building in code, look at the <i>Simple.bld</i> file
        in Skyscraper's buildings directory. It's also available online
