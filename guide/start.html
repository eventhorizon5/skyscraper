      <div align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buildings are stored in text
        files in Skyscraper's <em>buildings</em> folder, usually at
        "c:\program files\skyscraper\buildings" on Windows, or in the
        "buildings" directory on Unix. The filenames end in BLD, and so
        you need to make sure your text file ends with ".bld" and not
        ".txt". To create a new building, first open up a text editor,
        and read the instructions below. When you're finished, save it
        into the <em>buildings</em> folder shown above, as something
        like "mybuilding.bld". The building will appear when you choose
        "Other buildings..." in Skyscraper's main menu the next time you
        run it. A simplistic building is included for you to get a good
        idea of the overall format of a typical building data file. You
        might also want to open one of the other buildings that come
        with Skyscraper ("Triton Center.bld", "Glass Tower.bld", etc)
        for examples on the more advanced functions. Please note that
        the script syntax will change in the future.<br>

      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To see an example of a small
        simplistic building in code, look at the Simple.bld file in
        Skyscraper's buildings directory. It's also available online <a
href="http://svn.tliquest.net/viewvc/skyscraper/trunk/buildings/Simple.bld?view=co">here</a>.</p>
