        <div align="center">Buildings are stored in text files in
          Skyscraper's <em>buildings</em> folder, usually at
          "c:\program files\skyscraper\buildings" on Windows, in the
          "buildings" directory on Linux, and in "Library/Application
          Support/Skyscraper/buildings" in the user's home directory on
          Mac.&nbsp; The filenames end in BLD, and so you need to make
          sure your text file ends with ".bld" and not ".txt". To create
          a new building, the easiest way is to modify the Simple
          building, which is a new building tutorial.&nbsp; Copy the
          Simple.bld file, which is found in the "buildings" folder,
          into another file, such as MyBuilding.bld.&nbsp; When you're
          finished, save your building and run the simulator. The
          building will appear when you choose "Other buildings..." in
          Skyscraper's main menu. You might also want to open one of the
          other buildings that come with Skyscraper ("Triton
          Center.bld", "Glass Tower.bld", etc) for examples on the more
          advanced functions. Please note that the script syntax might
          change in the future.<br>
          <br>
          Buildings can also be created while the simulator is running,
          via the Console, but note that buildings aren't saved using
          this method.<br>

        simplistic building in code, look at the <i>Simple.bld</i> file
        in Skyscraper's buildings directory. It's also available online
