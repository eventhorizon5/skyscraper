        <div align="center">Working with the Skyscraper source code can
          be intimidating at first, but if you're familiar with C++, the
          code has been formatted to be easy to read and hopefully
          understand.<br>
          <br>
          The following diagram shows a birds-eye view of the simulator,
          when three sim engines are running.<br>

          Skyscraper's source code is divided class-wise in order to
          create layers of abstraction in the code.&nbsp; This makes it
          relatively easy to create object-related code in C++.&nbsp; In
          the image above, each major component is in a subfolder in the
          "src" directory.&nbsp; The SBS engine, as an example, is in
          the "src/sbs" folder.&nbsp; Skyscraper's frontend is
          relatively small, and is mainly used as a wxWidgets frontend
          to the simulator, the ability to add other frontends is
          possible.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b><font size="+2"><u>Frontend</u><br>
              <br>
            </font></b>Skyscraper's frontend is is both a small
          wxWidgets application and separately (if wxWidgets is not
          used), a native Ogre frontend for Skyscraper.&nbsp; It is used
          for the startup screen, initializing the simulator, it's
          initial objects, and the initial wxWidgets windowing
          framework.<br>
          <br>
          <b><font size="+2"><u>VM (Virtual Manager)</u><u><br>
              </u><br>
            </font></b>VM, or Virtual Manager, is a form of
          meta-simulator, a system designed to manage simulator engine
          instances.&nbsp; It operates in a similar way to a nanokernel
          or hypervisor, in that it is a monitor and environment for the
          simulator engines to run on.&nbsp; VM is responsible for
          creating simulator engine instances, shutting down engines,
          running sim engines in parallel, and moving between sim
          engines.&nbsp; It also manages the client components, such as
          the GUI and HAL.&nbsp; VM manages Engine Contexts, which are
          the basic environments that host the sim engines and script
          processors.<br>
          <font size="+2"></font><b><font size="+2"></font></b><br>
          <b><font size="+2"><u>GUI</u><br>
              <br>
            </font></b>The GUI component is the majority of the
          wxWidgets windowing code, used for the simulator's windows and
          dialogs.&nbsp; This component is a client of the VM (Virtual
          Manager) component.<br>
          <br>
          <u><b><font size="+2">HAL<br>
                <br>
              </font></b></u>The HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)
          component is responsible for all hardware library-related
          functions, such as graphics and sound, currently for the
          frontend.&nbsp; In the future this will also handle all
          related functions for SBS, currently SBS does most of the same
          functionality separately.&nbsp; This component is a client of
          the VM (Virtual Manager) component.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <font size="+2"><u><b>Script Processor</b></u></font><br>
          <font size="+2"></font><b><font size="+2"></font></b><u><b><font
                size="+2"></font></b></u><br>
          The Script Processor component is not only the script
          interpreter, but also demonstrates how to perform the C++
          equivalents of script code.&nbsp; The script processor is
          responsible for translating script commands into C++
          functions.&nbsp; The language is loosely based on the
          TrueVision3D graphics engine syntax (Visual Basic).<br>
          <br>
          <u><b><font size="+2">OpenXR<br>
                <br>
              </font></b></u>The OpenXR component is an experimental
          Virtual Reality feature.&nbsp; Skyscraper currently supports
          VR headsets, but doesn't yet support hand controls and some
          other things like on-screen displays.<br>
          <br>
          <u><b><font size="+2">Scalable Building Simulator (SBS)<br>
                <br>
              </font></b></u>The Scalable Building Simulator, or SBS, is
          a simulation engine designed with vertical simulation in
          mind.&nbsp; SBS was designed to simulate a single building in
          it's entirety, multiple SBS instances can be run together in
          parallel to create cities.&nbsp; SBS is a client of the VM
          (Virtual Manager) component.&nbsp; It runs within an
          environment called an Engine Context, which is created and
          managed by the VM system.&nbsp; An engine context is the
          combination of an instance of SBS and a Script Processor,
          together in a context.<br>
