      The Realtime Object Control window, is a relatively simple object
      controller, that enables or disables objects.<br>
      Keep in mind that certain mesh objects (such as Level) might not
      turn on or off properly, due to Skyscraper's mesh optimizer being
      in effect.<br>

      In Skyscraper, the <i>External</i> mesh is designed to surround
      your building, and is shown as the building's facade<br>
      during visits to other buildings elsewhere in the simulator.<br>
      <br>
      The <i>Buildings</i> mesh is no longer recommended to use, but is
      still supported.&nbsp; It was originally designed to show other
      buildings as empty facades in the simulator, but this was replaced
      with the Engine Contexts (now Virtual Manager) feature.<br>
      <br>
      The <i>Landscape</i> mesh is where any vegetation, roads, and
      other misc features should go.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Sky</i> is a system object, currently is the Caelum sky system.<br>
      <br>
      The <i>Elevators</i> checkbox turns on or off all elevators in
      the current simulator instance.<br>
      <br>
      The Per-Floor Objects are objects which are created on a per-floor
      basis, such as floors themselves, columns, shafts, and stairs.<br>
      <br>
      The <i>Interfloor</i> mesh is a space between floors/levels, for
      the building structure.<br>
      <br>
      <i>ColumnFrame</i> is a mesh that holds building columns.<br>
      <br>
      Each mesh can be enabled or disabled separately in the simulator.<br>
