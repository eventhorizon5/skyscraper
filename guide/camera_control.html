    <div align="center"> The <i>Camera Control</i> dialog shows the
      internal camera parameters, and allows the user to control the
      camera.<br>
      Skyscraper currently uses 1 camera by default, 2 cameras for VR
      mode (one for each eye), and support for more cameras will come in
      the future.<br>

      <i>Current Floor</i> shows the floor number the user is currently
      on, followed by the floor ID.<br>
      <i>Last Hit Mesh</i> is the last mesh the camera's collider hit,
      which is usually a floor or wall.<br>
      <i>Start Floor</i> is the floor the user started on, and the
      position is right after it.<br>
      The <i>FOV Angle</i> determines the view angle of the camera,
      decrease it for a wider view.<br>
      <br>
      The <i>Gravity</i> parameter changes the Bullet physics engine's
      gravity value, and Gravity On turns it on and off.<br>
      <i>Collisions</i> can be turned on and off using this, or by
      pressing the "v" key in the simulator.<br>
      <i>Goto Floor</i> is a simple way to teleport to a different
      floor/level.<br>
      <br>
      On the right are the camera movement and rotation controls.&nbsp;
      To move the camera over time, check the <i>Hold</i> checkbox and
      then move the camera using the axis buttons.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Set Camera</i> allows the user to manually set the position and
      rotation of the camera.<br>
