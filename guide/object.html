      The Object Manager allows you to list, create, move, delete and
      reset objects.&nbsp; It also shows object internal data such as
      the script line it was created on, script command, parent object,
      etc.<br>

    <div align="center"><img moz-do-not-send="true" src="objects.jpg"
        alt="Object Manager" width="647" height="532"><br>
      <br>
      The Move button opens the <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="move.html">Move Object window</a>.<br>
      <br>
      The Delete button deletes an object from the simulator.&nbsp; Keep
      an eye on the console when deleting an object,<br>
      because in certain situations the simulator will refuse to delete
      an object with dependencies.<br>
      <br>
      The Create button allows you to create objects in the simulator
      using a helper interface, that generates script commands.<br>
      <br>
      View Script shows the entire in-memory building script for this
      simulator instance.<br>
      <br>
      The Reset State button, resets the state of an object to the
      default, if supported by the object.<br>
