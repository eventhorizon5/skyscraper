      <div align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; Skyscraper is an advanced
        first-person 3D building and elevator simulator, written in C++,
        and has been in development since December 2002.&nbsp; It
        supports fully simulating 3D structures, each one in a defined
        "building", or simulator engine.&nbsp; Multiple simulator
        engines can be run in parallel, creating cities.&nbsp;
        Skyscraper is powered by the Scalable Building Simulator, or
        SBS, which is the sim engine behind each building.&nbsp;
        Buildings are written in a custom scripting language, loosely
        inspired by the TrueVision3D graphics engine syntax, and also
        Visual Basic 6, which is what Skyscraper was originally written
        in.<br>
        <br>
        Skyscraper imposes no real limits on most situations, so that it
        makes it possible to create buildings with hundreds or even
        thousands of floors, very large map environments with dozens or
        hundreds of buildings, and more.<br>

        In the above image, around 20 simulator engines (SBS instances)
        are running simultaneously, each representing a building.<br>
