      <div align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; Skyscraper is an advanced
        first-person 3D building, city, and elevator simulator, written
        in C++, the project started in December 2002.&nbsp; It supports
        fully simulating 3D structures, each one in a defined
        "building", or simulator engine.&nbsp; Multiple simulator
        engines can be run in parallel, creating cities.&nbsp;
        Skyscraper is powered by the Scalable Building Simulator, or
        SBS, which is the sim engine behind each building.&nbsp;
        Buildings are written in a custom scripting language, loosely
        inspired by the TrueVision3D graphics engine syntax, and also
        Visual Basic 6, which is what Skyscraper 1.0 (2004) was written
        in.<br>
        <br>
        Skyscraper imposes no real limits on most situations, so that it
        makes it possible to create buildings with hundreds or even
        thousands of floors, very large map environments with dozens or
        hundreds of buildings, and more.<br>

        In the above image, 29 simulator engines (SBS instances) are
        running simultaneously, each representing a fully-simulated
        building.<br>
