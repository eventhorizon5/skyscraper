    <div align="center">The Simulator Control Panel allows you to
      control every object in the simulator, with additional buttons for
      controlling properties of the simulator objects.<br>
      <br>
      The most important details are on the top left, primarily the
      floor you're on, which in the example is floor 0 (with 1 being the
      floor's ID).<br>

      Since Skyscraper supports running multiple buildings
      simultaneously, the Control Panel window only shows the
      information for the current simulator engine.<br>
      To switch simulators/buildings, use the <a
        href="virtual_manager.html">Engine Manager</a> feature.<br>
