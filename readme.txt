Release Notes
------------------------------

Skyscraper is a 3D virtual building simulator written in Visual Basic 6.0 using the
TrueVision3D graphics library which can be found at http://www.truevision3d.com.

The current building used in the simulator is the Triton Center, designed by Ryan Thoryk,
which originally got it's inspiration from the 137-story Glass Tower in the movie The Towering
Inferno, and 7 South Dearborn, a 112-story proposed building for downtown Chicago.
Original models (2D and 3D) of the Triton Center were made in MyHouse for Windows 6.5.
The building's features and locations of equipment currently don't aim to be 100% accurate
or even realistic, for example, the single stairwell for the whole building.  These might
be changed in newer models of the Triton Center, but we'll see.

Important keys used in the game:
3 - open elevator door
4 - close elevator door
5 - play elevator music (disabled in this release)
6 - stop elevator music (disabled in this release)
F1 - to take a screenshot (saves as c:\shot.bmp)
PgUp - Look upwards (warning - there's alignment problems with this)
PgDown - Look downwards (same problem with above)
Home - Float upwards
End - Float downwards


Current building floor layout:

M - Mezzanine inside the 3 story lobby
2-39 - Offices, section 1
40-79 - Office, section 2
