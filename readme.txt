Release Notes
------------------------------

Skyscraper is a 3D virtual building simulator written in Visual Basic 6.0 using the
TrueVision3D graphics library which can be found at http://www.truevision3d.com.

The current building used in the simulator is the Triton Center, designed by Ryan Thoryk,
which originally got it's inspiration from the 137-story Glass Tower in the movie The Towering
Inferno, and 7 South Dearborn, a 112-story proposed building for downtown Chicago.
Original models (2D and 3D) of the Triton Center were made in MyHouse for Windows 6.5.
The building's features and locations of equipment currently don't aim to be 100% accurate
or even realistic, but they might be changed in newer models of the Triton Center.

This release, version 0.92, contains 40 elevators, redesigned floor layouts, redesigned elevator
floor assignments, crawlspaces between each floor, multiple pipe shafts, multiple stairwells, 
many bugfixes, some adjustable variables (like elevator speed, height of crawlspaces, etc), code
cleanups, speed optimizations, and more.
