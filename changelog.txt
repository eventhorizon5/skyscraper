er cars

-reset mouse cursor when exiting to main menu
-FinishMove should turn on floor that the camera is active on, instead of the elevator's GotoFloor
-update naming of directional indicator meshes
-show main object name instead of mesh name, for click reports
-FinishDoors function should show a script error if it fails
-show an error if a scene node is not created properly
-when freelook is enabled in an engine, the mouse cursor needs to be updated when switching engines.  This also consolidates the related freelook code into a function.
-values need to be cleared when switching engines

-added object OnUnclick function, which is called when a mouse button is released on an object
-Hoistway Access mode now uses constant pressure on the switches to work, which can be turned off

-door movement now uses a standard parent runloop method, instead of a main simulator callback
-have call buttons use a Timer object for processing the call loop (frequency set to 1 second), instead of using a callback entry in the simulator root
-fixed a loop issue in the ProcessGotoFloor function that was causing some elevator cars to be skipped

-fixed computing of stored polygon plane, and polygon intersection functions now used the stored plane instead of computing one

-(OpenGL only) use standard texture copy method if dimensions are the same, to try to remedy texture copy crashes mainly on systems with Intel graphics, with small non-pow2 textures
-set name of FMod audio client, used with PulseAudio on Linux
-enhanced setting of adjusted floor 0 altitudes
