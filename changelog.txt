Version 1.10 (2.0 Alpha 10)
-------------------------
-FinishMove should turn on floor that the camera is active on, instead of the elevator's GotoFloor
-update naming of directional indicator meshes
-show main object name instead of mesh name, for click reports
-FinishDoors function should show a script error if it fails
-show an error if a scene node is not created properly
-when freelook is enabled in an engine, the mouse cursor needs to be updated when switching engines.  This also consolidates the related freelook code into a function.
-values need to be cleared when switching engines
-fixes for reported issues with multi-car support
-for the "Elevator:Car" script parameter, if just the elevator is specified, the code should find the car that services the floor, instead of just using the first car
-added INI file and script "HoistwayAccessHold" option
-added object OnUnclick function, which is called when a mouse button is released on an object
-Hoistway Access mode now uses constant pressure on the switches to work, which can be turned off
-actions can now have a "hold" state, which requires that a control have constant pressure to prevent it from reverting to (normally) an "off" position.  Used for Hoistway Access mode
-fixes for ShowMenu behavior and command line "no-menu" option
-added CheckScript mode, which allows scripts to be quickly checked for errors, instead of fully loading them
-fix for the "Stairwells" string match in the GetObjectRange function
-cleanups, found via cppcheck
-memory leak fix for Dynamic Mesh system - the mVertexElements array needs to be deleted on return
-(Scripts) added a check to ensure that a floor's altitude is properly set at the end of a Floor section
-(Scripts) move end-of-section code into per-section functions
-brought back ComputeNormal function, which was removed in revision 4679, due to precision issues causing certain walls to display improperly.  The issue appears to be due to Ogre's Plane function calculating in double-precision mode, with the ComputeNormal calculating in single-precision, so a workaround has to be found for Ogre.
-character controller should remove itself from Bullet world on delete
-call buttons should not store pointers to control objects; this fix now allows for the call button's controls to be deleted
-call button actions can now be used from scripts, and details have been added to the guide
-add note about how leaving the "texture" parameter blank for the button panel, will hide the back
-revamped Call Button objects:
--action system now supports Call Button actions

--switched Call Button object to use a Button Panel as it's button canvas
-objects need to unregister their dynamic runloops on deletion
-added virtual OnClick function for objects
-shut down resource manager on exit
-have character controller properly clean up objects when deleted
-call button timer should quickly fire on the first shot, before waiting a longer interval for future processing
-added support for dynamic runloops, which should help reduce per-frame loop overhead.  This functionality allows objects to optionally register themselves with their parents to activate/deactivate their runloops, and then the parent calls a LoopChildren() function to run all registered child loops
-door movement now uses a standard parent runloop method, instead of a main simulator callback
-have call buttons use a Timer object for processing the call loop (frequency set to 1 second), instead of using a callback entry in the simulator root
-fixed a loop issue in the ProcessGotoFloor function that was causing some elevator cars to be skipped
-fixed problem in FinishMove function, where the call button arrival notification was only checking the arrival direction of the primary floor call, not ones for other cars
-when adding an elevator route, the car number should be reported if the elevator has more than 1 car
-when enabling Hoistway Access, require shaft doors to be open on the specified floor

-moved Camera loop code and timing code into standard Loop function
-renamed SBS MainLoop to standard object "Loop", and moved camera loop call to end of SBS loop
-have ResetBuilding function be used as the standard object's ResetState function, and have it also reset the camera state if the camera's active.  This allows the SBS engine root to be reset, to reset the building state.
-removed SegmentPlane function
-removed and replaced old Classify function with an AABB test
-Cut function now skips polygons that are completely inside the cutting area, instead of needlessly processing over them and not getting cut results
-removed old point-on-polygon/findwall code
-removed old ComputeNormal function
-intersection functions need to convert the polygon's relative plane to absolute positioning
-fixed computing of stored polygon plane, and polygon intersection functions now used the stored plane instead of computing one
-engines shouldn't automatically make themselves the active engine on entry, if they're an ancestor of the active engine.  This fixes issues where overlapping engines' activations would bounce back and forth, causing colliders to fall through the ground, and wrong engines being selected
-moved shared script section variables into a separate Config Handler object, mainly to fix an issue where the shared variables were never reset on script interpreter shutdown/startup
-make sure elevator's CreateElevator function returns with error if the primary car has an error

-update profiler statistics every 10 frames instead of continuously
-added more performance metrics for the Profiler
-properly group radio buttons in Elevator Editor
-CameraState should store FOV value, so that the camera's FOV will be persistent when switching engines
-added "Simple - Top Box" building
-if a texture load fails, the texture resource needs to be removed afterwards.  This fixes an issue where the failed texture would show up as loaded, during a reload
-if elevator doors are open due to the elevator waiting in a peak mode, don't reset the door timers when a call button on the same floor is pressed
-(OpenGL only) use standard texture copy method if dimensions are the same, to try to remedy texture copy crashes mainly on systems with Intel graphics, with small non-pow2 textures
-set name of FMod audio client, used with PulseAudio on Linux
-enhanced setting of adjusted floor 0 altitudes
-if floor 0 is created after floor -1, adjust floor 0 based on floor -1's altitude
-when creating basement floors, if floor 0 is created first, properly calculate floor -1's altitude offset based on floor 0, instead of assuming a default value
-frontend size_t migrations, to simplify loop code
